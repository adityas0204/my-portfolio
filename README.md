# My Portfolio & Dev Playground

This project is an evolving technical playground used to explore web development and modern deployment workflows. It serves as a live environment where I test and implement new technologies as I learn them.

## Evolution of the Project

This repository has gone through several distinct phases:

* **Documentation Start**: It originally began as a simple experiment to host and organize personal notes on full-stack development.
* **Portfolio Transition**: I later evolved the project into a professional portfolio to showcase my work and skills.
* **Styling Overhaul**: I transitioned the entire codebase from traditional monolithic CSS (preserved in index.css) to a utility-first approach using Tailwind CSS for better design control and mobile responsiveness.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React 19
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.0
* **Backend/Hosting**: Firebase (Hosting & CLI)

## Current Focus & Roadmap

Because this project is built for continuous learning, I am currently working on and planning the following:

* **Logging**: Implementing logging systems to track application behavior and debug more efficiently.
* **SEO Research**: Exploring Search Engine Optimization to understand how to make web applications more discoverable and performant for search engines.
* **New Features**: Regularly experimenting with new visual designs and advanced CSS techniques to push the limits of the site's interface.
