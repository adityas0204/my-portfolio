# My Portfolio

The purpose of this portfolio was to master modern front-end styling. I transitioned from writing traditional, monolithic CSS files to using Tailwind CSS.

I started by learning about CSS rulesets, files, and properties in one large `index.css` file. That file can still be found in this project. Then, I transitioned the project to inline Tailwind CSS for mobile-first styling.
